Error Lookup

Description:
Portable open source tool which can help by translating error codes into a more meaningful text description. The interface is simple - just a box to type your code, and another which displays the details - so there does not seem much to learn.

The program also supports a wide range of codes: regular Windows API errors, Native API errors, DirectX, Windows Internet errors, STOP codes.
And we think it can probably be configured to read more (Settings > Modules).

The lightweight application is less than a megabyte, and it is compatible with Windows 8.1 and higher operating systems. You can download either the installer or portable version.

To activate portable mode, create "errorlookup.ini" in application folder, or move it from "%APPDATA%\Henry++\Error Lookup".
